# Keep talking and nobody explodes IRL
This is a real life game inspired by the video game called **"Keep talking and nobody explodes"**. It is a college project for the Embedded systems class. 
It uses a variety of electrical components and 2 Raspberry Pico Pi W's that communicate via MQTT. The game consists of several small challenges that have to be completed in order
to defuse the so called "bomb". But if you make a mistake you get a strike, and if you go over the maximum amount of strikes the bomb explodes. The bomb also explodes if you go over
the set time limit.
